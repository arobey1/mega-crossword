# mega-crossword

This is my last crossword for _The Swarthmore Phoenix_.  Of all the puzzles I created for this newspaper, this is by far the largest.  It contains 808 words and has 446 black squares.  The grid comprises a 50x50 partition of squares; regular puzzles are generally 15x15.  After creating crossword puzzles for this paper for the last two and a half years, this is truly my magnum opus.  I am incredibly grateful for everyone who has worked on my puzzles for the last few years; crossword puzzles are an integral part of who I am and I have been glad to share that with all of you.  In turn, I want to thank my dad for editing these puzzles and supporting me in this endeavor since the very beginning.  If youâ€™re interested in keeping up with my puzzles or playing any of the puzzles that have appeared in The Phoenix since I started writing for them, please visit my website at www.cruciverbalex.com.
